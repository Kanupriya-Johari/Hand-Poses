# Hand Pose Estimation And Classification

The Jetson Nano is a GPU-enabled edge computing platform for AI and deep learning applications. It is powered by a 64-bit quad-core ARM-CortexA57 CPU with 4 GB RAM onboard. It has 128 core Nvidia Maxwell GPU dedicated to several AI and deep learning applications making it suitable for prototype development as well as production.

The Jetson Nano developer kit which houses the Nano module, accessories, pinouts, and ports is ready to use out of the box. It runs a customized Ubuntu 18.04 called Linux4Tegra for the Tegra series chips powering the Nvidia Jetson modules.

# Required Components
- Jetson Nano Developer Kit
- Raspberry Pi Camera v2 ( Integrated by cloning https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/CSI-Camera )
- Power Source for Developer Kit
